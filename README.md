A cloud-based remote Android management suite, powered by NodeJS 
</p>

<p>Now users no longer need to sign the L3mon payload using Apk Editor. If you are a Termux/Kali Linux user, you will be able to easily build the payload of Lemon with the help of this repository, as well as use it in Kali Linux and Ubuntu without any errors. If you are a Kali or Ubuntu user, you need to have Java8 Installed on your machine or follow the rootless installation.</p>
